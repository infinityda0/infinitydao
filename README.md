# Develop Whitelabel Sites For Aragon DAOs
DAO created with Aragon client: https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/token/0x4fe43f85e4d794a13e8f5315b74642f084018a3b (rinkeby test network)

Infinity DAO is a project designed as a playground for all categories of Web3 users,
from complete beginners to the most experienced users,
with the aim of enabling easier interaction and exchange of information between them. 
This would potentially facilitate the entry of new users into the Web3 space,
who would be able to proactively participate (with economic incentives) in creation of unique content and in general the architecture of the DAO system itself.

Initially, DAO was created with the Aragon client on rinkeby test network, with an initial distribution of 100,000 INT tokens. INT is an Infinity DAO native token whose main goals are:
1. reward contributors of unique and quality content
2. governance rights (content perspective) - members voting in order to indicate the quality of submited content
3. governance rights (DAO perspective) - voting in order to create the ground rules and incentive architecture of DAO

The initial distribution of the INT token was determined as follows:
Founders (3) - 300 INT
DAO treasury - 99 700 INT
This initial distribution of DAO tokens provides an opportunity to build a fully decentralized system from the very beginning of the open organization.
The most basic applications are installed through the Aragon client:
- Voting
- Tokens
- Finance
- Agent
Further changes in the DAO architecture (tokenomics, type of content, communication channels, funds allocation etc.) will be possible when Infinity DAO has a minimum of 20 members.

Infinity DAO front-end was created with MintGate NFT storefront app, also on rinkeby testnet. The DAO storefront initially consists of 7 token-gated NFTs:

1. **Infinity DAO crowdfunding NFT (Genesis NFT)** -  minting "Genesis NFT" is for users that support DAO core idea to fund DAO or bounties for early contributors. Part of the collected funds is planned to be forwarded to Gitcoin grants projects that Infinity DAO supports (always next matching round).
2. **Membership NFT** - this NFT is kind of a "ticket" for DAO membership. The owners of this NFT have access to all content created by the DAO community. They also have the opportunity to contribute in any of the following areas and be rewarded with an INT token.
3. **Web3 movement NFT** - presents a collection of NFTs related to Web3 projects with a unique incentivized system. The constantly evolving collection works on the principle of "do-to-earn". In this way, it is planned to encourage the development of the Web3 project ecosystem in order to build a Universal Basic Income for Web3 users.
4. **Web3 tools NFT** - recommendations and guides for using necessary and useful Web3 tools to help you navigate decentralized systems.
5. **Branding NFT** - Unlock branding service for project and individuals from Web3 space. It isnt traditional pay/subscribe to service, but more as combined efforts from creating strategy to implementation with potential partnerships.
6. **Web3 Digital ID NFT** -  "Web3 digital ID" provides access to guides for creating a decentralized digital identity for individuals. NFT owners will also have the option to claim SLD (second-level domain) from offered TLDs, assistance in the verification process, and other actions important in DID public presentation.
7. **Web3 reviews NFT** - Owner of "web3 reviews" NFT has access to daily updated reviews of web3 projects, products, and tools. It is also possible to add your own reviews which will be rewarded depending on DAO members' votes.

NFT is a very broad term and an attempt to categorize it is almost impossible, given that it is any type of subjectively or objectively valued property or property that can be tokenized. Which means that NFT represents everything that can be tokenized except currency (fungible tokens), which is potentially the largest market ever (tokenized physical and digital assets). With the recommended content, we try to point out some very important categories of NFTs that would mean something more to new users than visual value.

Since we started with this bounty quite late and there was a lot of hurry, your feedback is very important to us. We will publish the content gradually.
